        <strong>KNIGHTS TOURNAMENT 2024 TOURNAMENT AND MEETING MANUAL</strong>
    </h1>
    <h2>
        <strong>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        This Tournament and Meeting Manual – contains the administrative and sporting rules for the regional
        competitions
        organized by the AHL and the FACHSC on an annual basis.
        Three entities will be formed:
    <ul>
        <li>The Tournament and Meetings Commission will be made up of a representative from each Association. Said
            Commission
            will appoint the Tournament Directors who will jointly be a representative of each Association.
        </li>
        <li>The Arbitration Commission will be made up of a representative of each Association.</li>
        <li>The Disciplinary and Misdemeanor Court will be made up of a representative from each Association.</li>
    </ul>
    Any circumstance and/or issue not contemplated in this manual will be considered and resolved by the Tournament and
    Matches Commission.
    The Tournament and Matches Commission may review and modify the regulatory issues that are necessary to achieve an
    improvement in both the sporting and administrative framework of the tournament.
    <h2>
        <strong>TOURNAMENT AND MEETINGS</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Tournament and Meetings Commission will organize the tournament and the meetings, which will be officially
        published through the bulletins of each Association.
        The Tournament and Matches Commission and the Tournament Director will be in charge of resolving and deciding on
        issues inherent to the development of the tournament.
        All official communication related to the tournament and the matches and/or decisions of the Tournament Director
        will be communicated through the official bulletins of each Association.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <strong>NUMBER OF PLAYERS</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The teams in all their categories will be composed of 11 (eleven) players. No team may begin to play if at the
        time
        indicated for the match to be played it has fewer than (7) seven players on the field.
        When a team does not meet the regulatory minimum, caused by a lack of presentation of the players, it will be
        given
        WO with a result of 3 to 0 in favor of the opponent, granting the rival the points in dispute.
        When a team due to injury to players, or due to multiple expulsion during a match (only by Red Card) does not
        comply
        with the regulatory minimum, it loses by disqualification, giving the opposing team a 3-0 victory, unless at the
        time of suspension of the match there would be a greater goal difference. The matches included in this point
        must
        not be played or continued under any circumstances.
        The rule will not be applied in cases of temporary withdrawals (green and yellow cards).
        The number of players per category may be modified by mutual agreement with the Tournament Directors.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <strong>TEAM REGISTRATION, FEES and OFFICIALLY ENABLED ENTITY</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Team registrations will be carried out in the administrative modality that the Tournament and Matches Commission
        decides, adopting the manual or computerized systems specified for team registration.
        They must be implemented by the entities competing in this tournament within the deadlines provided and
        publicized
        for such purposes.
        Compliance with deadlines must be strictly adhered to.
        Entities may withdraw from the incorporation of one or more teams after registration and before the start of the
        tournament but it will result in a penalty of 30% of the team registration fee in their respective association.
        The
        Tournament Commission will set the annual fees including all concepts and their amounts for the purposes of
        compliance by the entities participating in this tournament.
        Failure to comply with tariff obligations by entities will give rise to the intervention of the Disciplinary and
        Misdemeanor Court for the purposes of establishing the pertinent sanction.
        The entity will be qualified for the purposes of participating in the tournament once the requirements expressed
        in
        articles 5 and 6 of this manual have been met.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <strong>MEDICAL COVERAGE ON PLAYING FIELDS</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        All entities must have a licensed doctor on the field to cover potential injuries during the development of
        sports
        competitions.
        This on-field medical service is mandatory from the first division up to and including S14. If not
        If the doctor is present, the match(s) cannot begin.
        Compliance with this section is the exclusive responsibility of the entity that acts as the premises.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <strong>GREEN, YELLOW AND RED CARDS – AUTOMATIC SUSPENSION</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The calculation of green and yellow cards is the exclusive responsibility of the clubs. Three
        green cards count for a yellow one
        Three yellow cards count as one red and implies a suspension date that will be applied in all categories on the
        subsequent official date. The next 3 yellow 2 dates and so on. The Red Card disqualifies you from any activity
        (player, coach and any person included with activity on the match sheet) immediately.
        In the event of a red card, the referee's report and the player's defense must be submitted within three
        business
        days after the match to the Tournament's Disciplinary and Foul Court.
        In the event of repeat offenses, the penalty will be increased one match at a time.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <strong>PLAYER CHANGES</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The players registered on the scoresheet and authorized to play the match may replace any other player who is on
        the
        field of play.
        Replaced players are allowed to re-enter as many times as deemed necessary. The player
        who was expelled cannot be replaced.
        Players temporarily removed with green or yellow cards will be cleared for re-entry by the control table once
        the
        stipulated time has elapsed.
        Player changes must be made in the following way:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The goalkeeper can do so from any place on the court, and playing time must be stopped while it lasts.</li>
        <li>The other field players will do so in the middle of the field on the side where the substitute benches are
            located.
        </li>
    </ul>
